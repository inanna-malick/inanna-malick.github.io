      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a post about writing elegant and performant recursive algorithms in Rust. It makes heavy use of a pattern from Haskell called recursion schemes, but you don&#39;t need to know anything about that; it&#39;s just an implementation detail. Instead, as motivation, I have benchmarks showing a 14-34% improvement over the typical boxed pointer representation of recursive data structures in Rust.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the second in a series of blog posts on recursion in rust. The previous blog post introduced a method for writing performant stack safe recursion in Rust, but it was scoped to a single recursive data structure - a simple expression language. This post shows how to write &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; recursive toolkit that can handle expanding and collapsing any recursive data structure. This has been implemented, with examples, in the crate here and the repo here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
