      <description>Querying Cargo Build DAGs with Guppy guppy is a rust crate that provides tools for working with cargo build graphs using the full power of the petgraph graph data structure crate. It&amp;rsquo;s used by Facebook to audit a high-security subset of the cargo build graph for some of their more high-visibility projects. Treating the dependency graph resulting from a cargo build operation as a DAG lets us draw on the well-studied field of graph algorithms to answer complex questions about our build without resorting to ad-hoc traversals or re-implementation of common graph primitives.</description>
