            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Hi! I’m a software engineer with experience writing Rust, Haskell, Scala, and various other languages. I’ve worked on production Haskell applications (if you checked your offer status on the Starbucks mobile app recently, the request path probably included code I’ve written) and given conference talks on the intersection between recursion schemes and merkle trees (Monadic Party ’19).</p>
<p>Most recently, I’ve been focused on Rust. I currently have one open source library published (honeycomb-tracing) that uses the telemetry provided by Rust’s ‘tracing’ library to construct distributed traces. This came out of some personal projects I’ve been working on that have grown to include a GRPC backend, an HTTP shim layer, a frontend WASM app and headless browser tests, all written in Rust. It’s fast becoming my favorite language.</p>
